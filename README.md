# LLM Workshop Interactive Website

Here is the code for an interactive prompt engineering section of a workshop I teach on LLMs and Embeddings. The Notebooks along with this are also found on my Github (https://github.com/newksie/LLM-Workshop-Notebooks).

When running, the website is accessed at https://llmworkshop.onrender.com.
